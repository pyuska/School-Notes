CFD Project 2 (Orbiter L/D) notes

- Just put an unstructured domain on the trailing edge of the orbiter; not 
  fancy but it works
- When creating blocks, any orange lines on connectors indicate open surfaces
  that must be resolved before creating blocks. You should have one at the
  plane of symmetry in the middle, but nowhere else
- When resolving shocks, need to give 'breathing room' for shock in your domain
  around the vehicle. More room for lower freestream Mach. If the shock hits 
  the boundaries (front/sides), you have to rerun with a larger domain
- Use 'Recall View +/-<XYZ> to constrain hand-drawn arc to revolve to create 
  surface of revolution for flow domain to <XYZ> plane?
- Keep in mind that the max L/D for the shuttle might be at ~40 deg; keep space
  in your domain for the shuttle model to rotate significantly and still
  capture the entirety of the flowfield of interest
- Can impose a pressure outlet condition but Fluent will ignore it (pressure
  information, and all other information, won't propagate upstream in a
  supesonic flow)
- For high enough Mach numbers, numerical errors at the boundary (from 
  reflecting shocks) won't affect solution at orbiter (the one we're actually 
  interested in) due to shape of domain of dependence
- Try to pick a distance downstream for the outlet of your domain such that
  the flow will return to supersonic flow. Several vehicle lengths seems to
  be a reasonable length
- Engblom's domain kinda looks like the Apollo command capsule (BLUNT leading
  edge!)
- When drawing database lines to rotate to create domain, can only revolve
  (Create > Revolve) single line segment at a time. To revolve piecewise curve,
  have to join the curves together first (Ctrl+J)
- Change decay factor to affect spacing of grid on domain. (Grid > Domain > 
  Attributes) Use this to get smooth transition from spacing constraints
- Have to create/define a closed 3D shell from 2D domains before you can 
  construct a block. Once a block is constructed, still have to create the 
  T-rex inside
- Set the symmetry plane as a 'Match' BC for T-Rex. 'Orbiter' is Wall, far-field
  is 'Off' (default setting)
- Select block, then (Grid > Solve > T-Rex > Advanced > Collision Buffer): 0.5 
  is aggressive, 2 is better. Tells PW how conservative to be when growing grids 
  that will collide with other grids if growth continues
- Never run any serious cell-count project off of your P: drive or a flash drive,
  it will take forever. Save to local desktop and run from there.
- PW model is 1/30th scale, much easier to scale in Fluent than do full-size in PW
- Decay factor between 0-1; select domains of interest, then (Grid > Solve > 
  Attributes > Boundary Decay); 0.5 is default, need to get very close to 1
  (~ 0.95) for anything noticeable to happen. It seems like a value of 1 
  preserves connector spacing constraints throughout entire domain
- For more extreme flows, CFD results are more likely to be compared to other 
  analytical results, rather than experimental results, due to difficulty in 
  matching similarity parameters (Re, M) for subscale model tests
- Not really worth it in this case to spent time up front optimizing grid
  spacing. Do an initial run, determine where the shock is, use adaptive grid
  and let Fluent do the work
- Useful strategy to set different growth rates for different surfaces in T-Rex
  settings. Growth factor off of the nose of 1.05 might be better (5%), E had 
  it at 10% at first
- Fluent Quality check is measure of cell orthogonality
- FIRST thing to do in FLuent after importing is to go to (General > Scale >
  X,Y,Z Scaling Fcators > 30 > press Scale ONCE); only have to do this once.
- Changing air properties: Density : ideal gas, Cp: piecewise polynomial,
  viscosity: kinetic theory
- Change atmospheric pressure
- Flow inlet properties change (45deg AoA, x-comp); match the definitions of 
  Drag and Lift in report definitions
- Planform area: go to (Post-Processing > Projected Area > Z, set resolution)
- First order upwind solution
- Courant number of 0.1 to start
- When you first run it, will have a shock immediately on the nose of the 
  orbiter, set very low Courant number and induce lots of dissipative effects 
  to calm the solution down
