Introduction:
- illustration of 2D airfoil shape								HAVE
- table of freestream conditions and Re #							HAVE
- table of XFOIL estimate of max L/D ratio, max Cl, angles of attack @ Re = 1e6			HAVE

Methodology
- four figures of grid (LE, TE, entire airfoil, entire domain)					HAVE
- table of:
  - cell count (in PW: Grid > Cell Count...): 18,601						HAVE 
  - normal-to-wall spacing (deltaS): 1e-5							HAVE
  - boundary conditions										HAVE
  - reference values										HAVE
  - submodels chosen: k-omega SST								HAVE
  - numerical scheme: SIMPLE									HAVE
  - spatial accuracy: 2nd-order accurate							HAVE

Results:
- table of final force/coefficent values (Cl, Cd, L/D, Cm, L, D, M, all vs. AoA)		!
- line plot of resultant coefficient values against XFOIL data					!
- plots of streamlines and pressure contours for each AoA case (use same contour levels!)	!
- y+ curve for 0 deg AoA									!
- turbulent BL development for 0 deg AoA							!

Discussion:
- are the CFD results within +-10% of XFOIL?							!

Appendix:
- Cl & Cd convergence histories for every run							!
