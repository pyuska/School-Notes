Pointwise Notes

IMPORT
format for .dat files is:

<number of xyz coordinate triplets in the file>
x1	y1	z1
x2	y2	z2
etc

pointwise recognizes .dat files as 'Segment' files. to import in pointwise, go 
to File > Import > Database and select your .dat files. it's convenient to split
your airfoil contour into (at least) upper and lower curves to make it easier to
customize the grid

import as database; select your database in the List tab and go to Edit > Spline
to convert it to a smooth spline. this doesn't seem to carry over to the 
connectors built on top of the database, though.

Q for Dr. Engblom: we split the airfoil into upper and lower segments for grid
generation; are there other/better ways to divide it up? what about a LE segment
extending to about halfway along the chord, and an upper and lower curve
describing the remainder of the airfoil contour? (this would be done to 
eliminate the sharp artifact at the LE, for example)

When creating domain using Create > Assemble Special > Domain, HAVE to select and 
save the outer boundary first. Will fail domain generation otherwise.

When creating connectors, can mask databases so you don't accidentally snap to
them. If 'Show Points' is on for databases, can still accidentally select those 
points, even if databases themselves are masked off. Possible to hide databases 
entirely (Ctrl+Shift+F5), just don't forget to turn them back on when you import
new databases and wonder why they aren't showing up.

There's no way to edit certain aspects of entities after you create them (number
of nodes on a conncetor, for instance), so make sure you check the default 
settings before you create something.
