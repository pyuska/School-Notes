Things to avoid:
- massive blocks of equation text
- slides with no graphics; put lots of text in notes at end
- insufficient font size (18-20 minimum)

Things to include:
- roadmap of where we are, where we've been, especially when working with large
  equations
- why we're doing what we're doing in this step of the derivation
-
